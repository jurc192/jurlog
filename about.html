<p>
Iâ€™m Jure Vidmar and this is my small corner of the cyberspace. 
While it might turn into a personal logbook, I plan to write about my nerdy adventures in embedded software, hardware, 
free and open source stuff, copyright, DIY, hacking, repairing things and so on...
I am originally from Slovenia, but I currently <s>study</s> live in the Netherlands. 
Embedded Systems engineer. Hacker. Linux nerd.
