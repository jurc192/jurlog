Iâ€™m Jure Vidmar and this is my small corner of the cyberspace. In the physical space you can probably find me
in the Netherlands or in Slovenia or anywhere in between.
This website might turn into a personal logbook, but the plan is to write about my nerdy adventures in embedded software, hardware, 
free and open source stuff, copyright, DIY, hacking, repairing things and so on...
