    <p>
    Iâ€™m Jure Vidmar and this is my small corner of the cyberspace. 
    While it might turn into a personal logbook, I plan to write about my nerdy adventures in embedded software, hardware, 
    free and open source stuff, copyright, DIY, hacking, repairing things and so on...
    <!-- I am originally from Slovenia, but I currently <s>study</s> live in the Netherlands. 
    Embedded Systems engineer. Hacker. Linux nerd. -->
    In a physical space you can find me either in Slovenia or in the Netherlands. Depends on the weather and luck.
