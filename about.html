Iâ€™m Jure Vidmar and this is my small corner of the cyberspace. In physical space you can find me either in Slovenia or in the Netherlands.
While this thing might turn into a personal logbook, I plan to write about my nerdy adventures in embedded software, hardware, 
free and open source stuff, copyright, DIY, hacking, repairing things and so on...
