## Description

My room is tiny, my need for storage space is big. Was big. It's not a problem anymore, since I can hide lots of crap under this bed, which was designed and built from scratch!

Thanks to my flatmate Janez, who got me excited about woodworking, I dove into countless youtube tutorials, learned how to operate all kinds of tools and came out with a better bed.



## How it turned out
