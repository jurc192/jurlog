## Description

My room is tiny, my need for storage space is big. Was big. It's not a problem anymore, since I can hide lots of crap under this bed, which was designed and built from scratch!

Thanks to my flatmate Janez, who got me excited about woodworking, I dove into countless youtube tutorials, learned how to operate all kings of tools and came out with a better bed.


It was my first woodworking project, during my "IT detox" year where I tried to shift my hobbies outside of the computerland. 

## How it turned out
