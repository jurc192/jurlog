## Description

My tiny room needed more storage space, and my body needed a computerless hobby.
That is how I got into woodworking. After countless youtube tutorials and hours spent in the workshop, I ended up with all my fingers intact AND a custom made wooden bed frame!

Thank you Janez, Izidor, and the rest of the workshop crew - you made this experience possible, educational and fun!
