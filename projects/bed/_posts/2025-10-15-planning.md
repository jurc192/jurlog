# Planning and over-thinking

I live in a tiny room and since I prefer sleeping on hard surfaces, I like the idea of the futon bed. For some time I had this morning ritual of
folding the bed into sofa every morning. Since the sofa mode was quite uncomfortable and barely fit two people on it I wanted to change something.
Lots of tought went into ideas, but essentially I wanted to have a fixed bed spanning from wall to wall, so I can lean on the wall with my back when chilling on my bed, but also have some space for a book, phone, cup of tea, pile of clothes, whatever. Oh, and it was really cold in the winter to sleep so close to the floor, so I wanted to
raise my sleeping surface while keeping the firm feeling of sleeping on the ground.

This was during my IT detox period, where I decided to put my energy in real life analogue hobbies (instead of cyber stuff). It felt good. Anyways. Woodworking.

It started with defining the requirements:
- elevate the bed to allow approximatelly 50cm of storage space underneath
- stretch it so it spans from wall to wall
- make it sturdy and not wobbling or squeaking

Here are some of the original sketches and measurements of my room. The annoying part with the original stretched out futon bed was that it was cold, and that I could not lean on a wall because it would slide away from it. Besides no storage space.

# Design
When designing the bed frame, I had many questions such as: do I need two or three long beams? What thickness and type of wood should I use? What joints to use? Will the legs work okay? Do I need 4 or more legs?
Luckily, I had a woodworking mentor with lots of experience in building beds, with whom we resolved many of these - thanks Izidor!
When googling for schematics and designs, I realised that my idea is very specific and could not help myself with existing traditional bed designs found out that my idea is more of an stage platform rather than a traditional bed. So I could not use many of traditonal designs and I looked into designs of wooden stages and more large scale things. In the end I realised I am overthinking it too much and that I should JUST DO IT! 

This is the final design I went for:

# Educational fails
My first beginner fail happened at the earliest stage possible - when buying the wood and cutting it up for transport. I had to split 300cm beams into desired lengths, and somehow...something went wrong in my brain and I ended up with wrong dimensions (took into account the leftover instead of desired length). Luckily there was a spare beam of same size in the workshop I could use.

Then I moved into drawing the half-lap cuts for the legs and for the cross beams. Due to thick size of wood I did it on a miter saw, slicing up many cuts and then chiseling out the leftovers.

Also, when buying beams one can (should) not assume the ends are perfectly flat and perpendicular. It is a good idea to slice a thin layer off and then measure and cut to size. Well? I've had this in mind and forgot to remember it before drawing the cuts in 8/10 cases. Didn't stick. Also marking which side to cut from - can result in 1mm difference due to saw blade thickness. One of the cross beams is a millimeter shorter, but psst, nobody will ever see it or feel it, as it faces the wall anyways.s


# Half-lap joints

*half-lap joints*

I had to trim 3mm off the long beams, to get rid of the bevel. With all the joints finished, I moved to drawing and drilling holes for the legs.
Another fail was buying wrong size of rather expensive (but pretty, matte black) bolts. I did not take into account that screws in the front will be different length than those at the side (due to the half lap joint part).

Finally, I trimmed the bottom part of legs and sanded everything and coated it with...the thing that was easy to use and available at the workshop. While all this fits in a single sentence it took two or more afternoons :')

However, I was incredibly happy when I first assembled the frame together, bolted the legs and sat on it. NO SQUEAKING AND NO WOBBLING, super sturdy feeling, fuckyeah!


## Cost and time breakdown

wood                                    220e
fasteners                               50e
workshop and mentoring contributions    100e

working time approx 15 half-days, including 2 days of design and research


## Reflection

Half a year later, the bed is still sturdy and not squeaking. Provides the same firm feeling as sleeping on the ground and I can hoard a pile of clothes on one end, while storing books and cups of tea on the other end. Awesome! One of my favourite and most successful DIY projects so far.
