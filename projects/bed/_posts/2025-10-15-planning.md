title: "The need for sleep"

When I first moved into my tiny room, it was...really sad. Most of the furniture was really old and worn out, barely holding together. 
Replacing the bed with a foldable futon was exciting at first, but I soon realised it is not too comfortable as a sofa. That is when I quitted my morning ritual of folding it up, and started wishing for something more suitable for the space. I did love the firmness and groundedness of it though. Oh, and it was also really cold in the winters, you could feel the cold air radiating through the mattress from the ground.

This was during a time where I lost all my interest in software related stuff, and practically did not touch my computer for over a year.
My flatmate Janez was getting into woodworking at the time, for similar reasons, which was a great inspiration to try it myself. I am going to build my own bed!

# Design

This were the design requirements I started off with. The bed had to be:
- elevated to provide around 50cm of storage space underneath
- spanning from wall-to-wall
- sturdy and not squeaking

I considered multiple options regarding the bed frame design: three plywood boxes, only box frames, or simply a platform with four legs. 
The latter turned out to be the simplest and cheapest to do, but opened lots of questions: *do I need two or three long beams? What thickness and type of wood should I use? What joints to use? Will the legs work okay? Do I need 4 or more legs? And so on...*

Luckily, I had a woodworking mentor with lots of experience in building beds, with whom we resolved many of these - thanks Izidor!

This is the final design I went for:

# Materials

I decided to use spruce construction wood (laminated glued beams), as it was the cheapest and sturdiest option available. Not sure if using construction wood for indoor furniture is a bad idea in terms of health, but oh well... that's what I can afford at this point.

My first fail happened, before I even got the materials to the workshop!
Since you can only order beams of 3 or 4 meters, they have to be cut up for transport - they do it for free at the store!
However, something went wrong when I calculated the lengths, ending up with a part which was 20cm too short!
Luckily there was a spare beam of same size in the workshop I could use.


# Half-lap joints

I cut the beams to size and started drawing the half-lap joint cuts. Due to thick size of wood, used miter saw for cutting the joints, cleaning up with a chisel.

Despite knowing that the end of beams are not necesarily flat and perpendicular, I forgot to slice off the end, before cutting the beams to size. That is how I ended up with ~2 mm shorter legs than planned, but whatever.

Next, I had to trim the 3mm chamfered edges off the long beams, using a table saw.

Finally, I trimmed the bottom part of legs and sanded everything and coated it with wood preservative (Silvanol,.. the thing that was available at the workshop). While all this fits in a single sentence it took two or more afternoons :')

However, I was incredibly happy when I first assembled the frame together, bolted the legs and sat on it. NO SQUEAKING AND NO WOBBLING, super sturdy feeling, fuckyeah!


# Bolts

Since I live in a short-term rental apartment, I wanted to be able to dissassemble the bed. That is why, I used 10 mm thick, ?? cm long bolts for holding the joints together.

## Cost and time breakdown

| wood              | 220 € |
| bolts             |  40 € |
| workshop          | 100 € |
| TOTAL             | 360 € |

Time spent on this project is approximately 15 half-days, including 2 days of design, research and shopping.


## Reflection

Half a year later, the bed is still sturdy and not squeaking. It has the same firm feeling, as sleeping on the ground, but provides lots of storage underneath and on the sides. The shelf below the feet is covered with a pile of used clothes, so it became an indispensable part of my room. It is one of my favourite and most successful DIY projects so far, really satisfied with it :)
