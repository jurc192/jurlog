# Using CD-drive as a music player
## Overview

Using an old CD-drive as a "standalone" CD-player controlled by a microcontroller. 
The point of this project is the learning process and documentation of it, not the CD-player itself. 
There are many people saying that it's not worth building such thing, but I say it's bullshit. 
Re-using old electronic devices is best way to reduce e-waste and to learn about technology. 
Also your CDs become a little less useless :)
